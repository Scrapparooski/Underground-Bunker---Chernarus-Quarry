# Underground-Bunker---Chernarus-Quarry

Previously only available in Livonia, this mod is an underground bunker situated at the quarry near Severograd.

This mod contains the .dze so you can export it in any format that suits you. Also included is the cfgundergroundtriggers.json and mapgrouppos.xml as well as the zombie territories .xml files.

You will need to copy/paste all of the Land_Underground pieces from the mapgroupproto.xml in the mpmissions/enoch folder into the file of the same name in the mpmissions/chernarusplus folder.

This was my first build in the DayZ Editor. I'd like to thank AdminMike from the NoobsOnly server for advice & collaboration as we each built our own underground bunkers for the server. 

Feel free to edit, manipulate, think obsessively about this build, and/or use this build as you see fit. I do not give permission to repack or reupload this mod.

## Expansion Use

There are some base static items (Camp table & Camp Chair) that are missing if you run an expansion modded server.  The result is that there will be some missing "ghost" objects, that you cannot see, and cannot walk through.  If you are running an Expansion Modded server, you should use the QB2_Expansion.dze instead of the QB2.dze.
