# Underground-Bunker---Chernarus-Quarry

Previously only available in Livonia, this mod is an underground bunker situated at the quarry near Severograd.

This mod contains the .dze so you can export it in any format that suits you. Also included is the cfgundergroundtriggers.json and mapgrouppos.xml as well as the zombie territories .xml files.

You will need to copy/paste all of the Land_Underground pieces from the mapgroupproto.xml in the mpmissions/enoch folder into the file of the same name in the mpmissions/chernarusplus folder.

This was my first build in the DayZ Editor. I'd like to thank AdminMike from the NoobsOnly server for advice & collaboration as we each built our own underground bunkers for the server. 

Feel free to edit, manipulate, think obsessively about this build, and/or use this build as you see fit. I do not give permission to repack or reupload this mod.
